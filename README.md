> Powerensics is a Powershell script that can be in your DFIR toolkit. This PowerShell script performs live data extraction from the Windows host. It was created with community collaboration and its purpose is to collect noteworthy artifacts that can help improve the forensic investigations of the Incident Response Team. Powerensics extracts the items most relevant to the investigator, so it has less work to do and can focus on other tasks to speed up the investigation.

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.0 or higher
